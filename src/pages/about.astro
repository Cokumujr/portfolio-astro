                            <p>
                                From electrical engineering to full-stack
                                development, my path hasn't exactly been linear.
                                Then again, when is life ever? That's what makes
                                it interesting. I started out tinkering with
                                circuits and hardware, but somewhere along the
                                way, not too long ago, I was pulled into the
                                logic and creativity of software and the sheer
                                possibility of what you can build with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What began as automating boring little tasks
                                quickly turned into building full applications,
                                and before I knew it I was spending countless
                                hours in front of the screen. The moment your
                                code finally works after hours of debugging
                                never gets old. I consider chasing a bug the
                                ultimate equalizer, it humbles the experts and
                                the rookies alike, haha.

                                Beyond code, I'm deeply committed to causes that
                                matter. Effective Mental health management, rare
                                disease awareness, and addiction recovery aren't
                                just buzzwords to me, they're issues I care
                                about because I've seen how much they impact
                                real people. I believe everyone deserves access
                                to resources and support in these areas,
                                regardless of their circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These commitments are actually part of why I
                                pivoted into software engineering. Technology
                                has genuine power to democratize access to
                                critical resources, and I want to work on
                                projects that leverage that potential for real
                                social good. If you're building tools in
                                healthtech, accessibility, or platforms for
                                underserved communities, let's talk.

                            Cinema, football, music, and even political
                            discourse keep me engaged with the world outside my
                            IDE. I don't see these as separate from my work,far
                            from it,they influence how I think about
                            storytelling in interfaces, how systems serve
                            diverse communities, and how technology fits into
                            culture at large.

                                Good code, like good design, should work so
                                smoothly you hardly notice it. I aim for clean,
                                maintainable solutions that don't require a PhD
                                to figure out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My process is simple: start small, iterate
                                often, and never stop learning. Tech moves fast,
                                and staying curious is the only way to keep up.
                                Mentorship plays a huge role in bridging skill
                                gaps, and I'm always open to being mentored,
                                learning and sharing what I know.
                            </p>

                                If you're building tools that matter,whether
                                that's supporting mental health, creating
                                platforms for underserved communities, or even
                                just debating film or football tactics,I'd love
                                to connect.
