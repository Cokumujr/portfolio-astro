                                From electrical engineering to full-stack
                                development my path hasn't been linear,when is
                                life ever ?, and that's what makes it
                                interesting. I started tinkering with circuits
                                and hardware, but somewhere along the way not so
                                long ago, I was drawn to the logic and
                                creativity of software and the sheer possibility
                                of building so much with it.

                                What started as automating boring tasks turned
                                into building full applications, and now I spend
                                so many hours infront of the screen. The moment
                                when your code finally works after hours of
                                debugging? That never gets old.

                                    lol. Greatly recommend AppleTv+.Tell me why
                                    McConaughey didn't win the emmy for True

                                    shuffle caters for everyone in the car. In
                                    another life I believe I'd make a good DJ.
                                    Music is such an important part of the human
                                    experience,one of the best parts infact.
                                    Absolutely recommend Ludovico Einaudi and
                                    Hans Zimmer when coding or studying.

                                    sitting behind a screen. Endorphins are a
                                    hack for that good Mental Health.

                                I believe good code is like good design - it
                                should just work without you noticing it. I'm
                                all about clean, maintainable code that doesn't
                                need a PhD to understand.

                                My approach: Start simple, iterate often, and
                                never stop learning. The tech world moves so
                                fast, and staying curious is the only way to
                                keep up. Mentors are key in bridging skill gaps.
